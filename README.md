# SkyBlock
This is a barebones version of the ProtoSky skyblock mod: <br/>https://github.com/DeadlyMC/ProtoSky  
Omitting the generation of the end portal frames, obsidian pillars, <br/>
end crystals, shulkers and elytra. For all vanilla skyblock purists!<br/>
<br/>(Note, obsidian pillars and end crystals still regenerate as normal <br/>upon resummoning the dragon.)<br/><br/>
All blocks and entities are removed _after_ they are generated as to <br/>
ensure that the structure bounding boxes are generated in their <br/>
original position.<br/><br/>
***WARNING:*** do not open any pre-1.18 worlds with this mod active!<br/>
While converting from pre 1.18 to post 1.18, the mod will remove all<br/> blocks and entities
in the old chunks.<br/> Remove the mod, convert your world and re-add 
the mod afterwards.<br/>
Updating between any post 1.18 versions should be fine, although I do<br/> 
recommend backing up your world beforehand. <br/><br/>
The mod can be downloaded on the right under release 1.2<br/>
This is also where you can find a recreation of the orginal<br/>
skyblock 2.1 map with seed: -5013545841426130646<br/>
(spawn chunks generated in 1.18)<br/><br/>

I have also included a map that starts you off with only a chest <br/>
containing the bare minimum items to get _all_ renewable resources. <br/>
Although, I highly recommend adding an iceblock and maybe pointed <br/>
dripstone to speed up the beginning. If you're an absolute masochist, <br/>
you can replace the dirt and sapling by a composter, eliminating 1 more <br/>
starting item. Alternatively, you can start of with only lava, grass and a <br/>
sapling to get most renewable resources. Feel free to add and/or remove <br/>
items yourself!


# Requirements
Fabric Installer: https://fabricmc.net/use/

If you have any trouble with a part of the installation, <br/>I made a step by step on the process:<br/>
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BWKdWrVqP9K3t1T7GJG-C6UjfWvbO4MiADr9DMjai00/ <br/>
The tutorial is written for 1.18 but the steps are the same for <br/>
subsequent versions.
