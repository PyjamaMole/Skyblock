# SkyBlock
This is a barebones version of the ProtoSky skyblock mod: <br/>https://github.com/DeadlyMC/ProtoSky  
Omitting the generation of the end portal frames, obsidian pillars, <br/>
end crystals, shulkers and elytra. For all vanilla skyblock purists!<br/>
<br/>(Note, obsidian pillars and end crystals still regenerate as normal <br/>upon resummoning the dragon.)<br/><br/>
All blocks and entities are removed _after_ they are generated as to <br/>
ensure that the structure bounding boxes are generated in their <br/>
original position.<br/><br/>
***WARNING:*** do not open any pre-1.18 worlds with this mod active!<br/>
While converting to 1.18, the mod will remove all blocks and entities<br/>
in the old chunks. Remove the mod, convert your world and re-add <br/>
the mod afterwards.<br/><br/>
The mod can be dowloaded on the right under release 1.0<br/>
This is also where you can find a recreation of the orginal<br/>
skyblock 2.1 map with seed: -5013545841426130646<br/><br/>
I have also included a map that starts you off with only a chest <br/>
containing the bare minimum items to get _all_ renewable resources. <br/>
Although I highly reccomend adding an iceblock and maybe pointed <br/>
dripstone to speed up the beginning. If you're an absolute masochist <br/>
you can replace the dirt and sapling by a composter, elliminating 1 more <br/>
starting item.
