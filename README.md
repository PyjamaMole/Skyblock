# SkyBlock
Main page: https://modrinth.com/mod/basicskyblock <br/><br/>
This is a barebones version of the ProtoSky skyblock mod: <br/>https://github.com/DeadlyMC/ProtoSky  
Omitting the generation of the end portal frames, obsidian pillars, <br/>
end crystals, shulkers and elytra. For all vanilla skyblock purists!<br/><br/>
All blocks and entities are removed _after_ they are generated as to <br/>
ensure that the structure bounding boxes are generated in their <br/>
original position.<br/>
The +entities version does not remove entities, although they do <br/>
fall into the void. They may be catchable using flying machines.<br/><br/>
(Note, obsidian pillars and end crystals still regenerate as normal <br/>upon resummoning the dragon.)<br/><br/>
The mod can be downloaded on the left.<br/>
You can find a recreation of the original<br/>
skyblock 2.1 map with seed: -5013545841426130646<br/>
at: https://github.com/PyjamaMole/Skyblock/releases/ <br/>
(1.18 maps under v1.0 and updated 1.19 maps under v1.4)
<br/><br/>
***WARNING:*** do not open any pre-1.18 worlds with this mod active!<br/>
While converting from pre 1.18 to post 1.18, the mod will remove all<br/> blocks and entities
in the old chunks.<br/> Remove the mod, convert your world and re-add 
the mod afterwards.<br/>
Updating between any post 1.18 versions should be fine, although I do<br/> 
recommend backing up your world beforehand. <br/><br/>
I have also included a map that starts you off with only a barrel <br/>
containing the bare minimum items to get _all_ renewable resources, <br/>
and complete _all_ advancements. <br/>
I have however included some items in the inventory to make early <br/>
game more bearable. Feel free to make your own selection! <br/><br/>


# Requirements
Fabric Installer: https://fabricmc.net/use/

If you have any trouble with a part of the installation, <br/>I made a step by step on the process:<br/>
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BWKdWrVqP9K3t1T7GJG-C6UjfWvbO4MiADr9DMjai00/ <br/>
The tutorial is written for 1.18 but the steps are the same for <br/>
subsequent versions.
